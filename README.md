BeachedWhale removes Windows 10 bloatware

This program can remove all of the bloatware applications that come preinstalled and/or installed later without your consent from Windows 10. 

It's fast, easy to use, and safe. Let me know what you think!

You can download it from here on GitHub.

HOW TO USE:
1. Click this link to download the .zip: https://github.com/southpaw5271/BeachedWhale/archive/master.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to wherever you want.
3. Right click on the BeachedWhale7.2.ps1 file and click Run with PowerShell.
4. If you see a security error don't panic, this is normal for systems that have never run PS scripts before. Hit the letter 'A' and press enter. 
5. Click the buttons. If you don't click a button, those apps won't be removed. 

NOTE: Remove OneDrive should start the silent uninstall process. It will only prompt you once using UAC and then do everything in the background.

NEW!: There is now a list of the apps that will be removed included in the zip. The apps itâ€™s referencing are only the pre-installed apps. Meaning that if you installed Microsoft One Note, only the basic bloatware version will be removed.
