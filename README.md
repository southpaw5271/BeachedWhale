BeachedWhale removes Windows 10 bloatware

This program can remove all of the bloatware applications that come preinstalled and/or installed later without your consent from Windows 10. 

It's fast, easy to use, and safe. Let me know what you think!

You can download it from here on GitHub.

NEW: Updated to version 1803. Now removes bloatware from every Windows 10 version up to and including 1803. I switched to the same version number as Windows 10 itself to show what version it can remove bloatware from. 

HOW TO USE:
1. Click this link to download the .zip: https://github.com/southpaw5271/BeachedWhale/archive/master.zip
2. Extract the contents of the .zip file to wherever you want.
3. Right click on the BeachedWhale1803.ps1 file and click Run with PowerShell.
4. If you see a security error don't panic, this is normal for systems that have never run PS scripts before. Hit the letter 'A' and press enter. 
5. Click the buttons. If you don't click a button, those apps won't be removed. 

NOTE: Remove OneDrive should start the silent uninstall process. It will only prompt you once using UAC and then do everything in the background.
